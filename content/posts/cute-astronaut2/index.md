## Intro
This is part 2 of a series where I talk about theatre engineering for the play [You're Too Cute to Be An Astronaut](https://www.cuteastronaut.com/). In [part 1](/posts/cute-astronaut/) of this series you can find out about the motivation for the play and its audio design. This part will focus on the automation for the play.

## Flying Solo
One of the constraints for the location of the play, was that our actor, Judy needed to perform solo, without any outside help. There would be no theatrical tech in the room where the play would be performed. Other actors performing at this location cope with this to use their phone to trigger audio cues and press trigger buttons on a light controller by hand while also performing. We both felt we could do better. I mean, we have the technology right?
