Hi, I'm Willem Vooijs.

I'm a Product Manager by profession with a passion for tinkering with technology. When I'm not working, you'll find me experimenting with electronics projects, building home automation systems, contributing to open source software, and exploring sustainable energy solutions.

I made this website, which runs on a box in my basement. Yes, I like to live dangerously.

This site is where I share my projects, thoughts, and explorations in technology and sustainability.
